Soby :

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/soby.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/soby)


Presentation software based on SVG created by Sozi.

### Concept :

* Presentation softwares are cool things.
* Presentation softwares are limited, and creating animations is
  awfully difficult.
* [Processing](http://processing.org) is awesome.
* [JRuby_art](https://github.com/jashkenas/ruby-processing) is
  super-awesome, because it is Processing and it can be live and
  interpreted.


The slides can contain anything than can be displayed in our [extended 
version of Processing](https://github.com/poqudrof/processing/releases/tag/3.0-svg).

So it is :
- Images loaded in code or ebmedded in a SVG. 
- Videos using the [Processing video library](https://github.com/processing/processing-video).
- Cool generative designs, coded in scripts or directly in the SVG file. 
- Like Sozi the presentation software changes the view on a SVG image created in inkscape.
- Unlike Sozi, it is not self-contained. For now it requires Processing, JRuby and a few ruby gems. 

Animations are supported.

#### Issues

It requires a specific version of Processing which enables to load
images from SVG files :

### How to use ?  (linux) 

 1. Install our custom version of Processing : https://github.com/poqudrof/processing/releases/download/3.0-svg/processing-svg.tar.gz
 2. Install the [processing Video library](https://github.com/processing/processing-video) and GStreamer if you are on linux. 
 3. Install Jruby Art, follow the instructions there : [https://github.com/ruby-processing/JRubyArt]
 4. Install Soby using rubygems : `gem install soby`
 5. Clone the repository.
 6. Try out an example: `cd Soby/examples/video ; jruby start.rb`  . 


Please remember this library is in its early development stage.

### How to use (Windows & Mac) 

Follow the same steps as in Linux. You should Hack your processing version with the one given here. 

>To Hack it replace: 
> `yourProcessing/core/library/core.jar` by our `processing-svg/core/library/core.jar` . 

With standard Processing it will work, without text and images which is less interesting.
